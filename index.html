                First of all, what in the hell is an ADSR?
            </li>
            <div class="ans">
                ADSR is a wave-generating method used in electronic music for some style points.
                Rather than a boring constant-over-time sine wave, this method generates sound waves
                that are more pleasing to the average listener.
                On top of that, it helps softwares emulate the timbre of real life instruments such as
                flutes and guitars.
                It's also present in pretty much all music composing softwares, and has become a staple
                in electronic music since its birth.

                <div class="ans">
                    A: Attack; means how long the wave takes to go from amplitude (volume) zero to its peak;

                <div class="ans">
                    D: Decay; means how long the wave takes to go from its peak to its sustain volume;

                <div class="ans">
                    S: Sustain; means the stabilized wave volume after the peak;

                <div class="ans">
                    R: Release; means the amount of time spent to reach zero after
                    the key has been relased. It's worth noting that the key can be released at
                    any point, including during Attack and Decay phases;
